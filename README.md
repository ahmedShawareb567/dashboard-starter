# Dashboard Starter 〰️

Welcome to my React app! This app was built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Node version >= (v16.14.1)

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

```pash
git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
```

- Install the dependencies:

```pash
yarn
```

- Start the development server:

```pash
yarn dev
```

The app will now be running at `http://localhost:5000`. Any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

## Building and Deploying

To build and deploy the app, run the following command 🧪 :

```pash
